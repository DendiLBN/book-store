About this app
This app is a part of a full-stack project, covering both frontend and backend, and built with modern web technologies. The frontend is developed using React with TypeScript, utilizing Redux Toolkit and RTK Query for state management. The backend is based on NestJS and Node.js with Express, providing authentication, image processing, and email notifications.

Main features of the app include:

User registration and login,
Email password reset,
Adding and removing items from the shopping cart, (inprogress)
Viewing transaction history and purchase details, (inprogress)
Searching items by category or keywords, (inprogress)
Admin capabilities to modify user information and review transaction details.
Technologies and libraries (inprogress)

On the frontend, the following technologies and libraries were used:

TypeScript – for static typing,
React – to build the user interface,
Redux Toolkit – for state management,
RTK Query – for handling queries and data caching,
React Router – for navigation between components,
Ant Design – UI components,
Axios – for handling HTTP requests.

On the backend, I used:

NestJS – a Node.js framework,
Express – as the core HTTP server,
bcryptjs – for password hashing,
jsonwebtoken – for authorization and generating JWT tokens,
nodemailer – for sending emails,
mongoose – as the ORM for MongoDB.
