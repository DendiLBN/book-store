# About this app

The client side of this app was created using React and TypeScript, while the server side was developed using NestJS and Node.js with Express.

My main goal in creating this app was to build a functional version of an online store with essential features, including:

- User registration and email confirmation,
- Password reset,
- User login,
- Adding and removing items from the shopping cart,
- Viewing transaction history and purchase details,
- Searching items by category or keywords,
- Admin capabilities to manage user information, review transactions, and modify the store inventory.

## Technologies and libraries

### On the client side, I used the following technologies:

- **TypeScript** – for static typing,
- **React** – to build the user interface,
- **Redux Toolkit** – for state management,
- **RTK Query** – for handling data queries and caching,
- **React Router** – for navigation between components,
- **Ant Design** – UI components,
- **Axios** – for HTTP requests.

### On the server side, I used:

- **NestJS** – a Node.js framework,
- **Express** – as the HTTP server,
- **bcryptjs** – for password hashing,
- **jsonwebtoken** – for handling JWT-based authentication,
- **sharp** – for image processing,
- **nodemailer** – for sending email notifications,
